"""Patch The Maze of Galious Enhanced (bladeba v1.04: 512KB Konami-SCC, MSX2)
so it saves to and loads from 3 slots in Yamanooto flash instead of showing/
typing the password. Same behaviour as galious_to_yamanooto.py:

- Password room, after YES: no password on screen; "Save in which slot?" and
  the state of the 3 slots; keys 1/2/3 save.
- Title + L (state 0x12): instead of the typing screen, the 3 slots; keys
  1/2/3 load. The game checks the loaded password with its own sum and
  restores the game exactly as if it had been typed.

The Enhanced keeps the original's password code and RAM, moved inside bank 2,
but draws in SCREEN 5 with its own text routine, so the driver leaves its text
in RAM and the shim draws it with that routine (see launcher/galious_enhanced_*.asm).
Nothing grows: the shim goes in the tail of bank 3 the Enhanced blanks (ROM
0x7E65-0x7FFF, nothing points there) and the driver in bank 0x0C, 8KB of 0xFF
that nothing maps. The game is already Konami-SCC, the mode a Yamanooto
starts in: no bank switch to move. The 64KB save sector is relative bank 0x40,
right after the game (the packer leaves it blank): no 64KB block inside the
512KB is free.

Input: the Enhanced ROM, i.e. bladeba's "Galious Enhanced V1.04.ips" applied
to the original RC-749 dump (SHA-1 4d51d3c5...). Every patched site is checked
against the expected bytes and the script refuses on any mismatch.
