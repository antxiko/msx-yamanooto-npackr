# Changelog

## v0.95 — 2026-05-22

- **NEW: native cross-platform GUI builder** (`gui-rs/`, Rust + egui).
  Single static binary; drag-and-drop ROMs, mapper auto-detect against an
  embedded `softwaredb.xml`, ASCII8/ASCII16 conversion on the fly, marquee
  customization, splash toggle, build and save. No Python needed.
- Pre-built binaries for **macOS** (arm64 + x64), **Linux** (x64), and
  **Windows** (x64) attached to this release.
- **Marquee redesign**: the anti-scam notice no longer prefixes the
  marquee — it's already on the boot splash. The marquee is now a single
  128-char buffer (×2 for the no-wrap display trick), fully customizable.
- **Boot splash toggle**: new packager-rewritable config block
  (`YMNTCFG!` magic + flag bytes) in `launcher.bin` lets the GUI checkbox
  "Show boot splash" enable or disable the splash without recompiling.
- The Python packager (`packager/yamanooto_pack.py`) stays as historical
  reference / CLI alternative. Both share `launcher.asm` + `launcher.bin`
  and use the same on-flash directory format.

## v0.94 — 2026-05-22

- **`--marquee "your text"`** flag on `build` and `pack-folder` lets you
  customize the scrolling marquee text at the bottom of the in-cart menu
  *without recompiling the launcher*. The hardcoded anti-scam notice
  (`ESTA HERRAMIENTA ES GRATUITA · SI HAS PAGADO POR ESTA ROM, TE HAN
  ESTAFADO`) is always shown; only the trailing 64-char buffer is
  replaced. TOML config can set `[launcher].marquee = "..."` instead.
- `launcher.bin` now reserves a 64-byte custom buffer (×2 for the no-wrap
  trick) immediately after the anti-scam prefix. Default value points
  users to the toolkit's GitHub repo.

## v0.93 — 2026-05-22

- **ASCII8 and ASCII16 conversion validated end-to-end** in openMSX 21 with
  real GoodMSX dumps:
  - ASCII8: **1942** (Capcom, 1987) — 23 patches applied, boots and plays.
  - ASCII16: **Golvellius** (Compile, 1987) — 2 helper installs + 11 bank
    switches patched, boots and plays.
  - Both packed together into a single 2MB image via `pack-folder
    --auto-convert --flash-size 2MB` in one command.
- ASCII16 → K5 path no longer marked "experimental" in the docs.
- Catalog of known clean GoodMSX SHA1s for ASCII8/ASCII16 dumps now
  acknowledged in the README's "Validated games" section.

## v0.92 — 2026-05-22

- **`pack-folder --auto-convert`**: detects ASCII8/ASCII16 ROMs and runs the
  K5 conversion in memory automatically, so a folder full of mixed mappers
  packs in a single command.
- More flat mapper aliases recognized as `plain` (Normal, 0x0000, 0x4000,
  0x8000, 8kB, 16kb, Page2, Page12, Mirrored4000).
- Explicit "not yet supported" tagging for ASCII8 SRAM / ASCII16 SRAM /
  KoeiSRAM / GameMaster2 / Page23 / R-Type / Cross Blaim — the packer now
  prints a useful message instead of silently dropping.
- New explainer doc: [`docs/SCC_ALIGNMENT.md`](docs/SCC_ALIGNMENT.md) walks
  through the openMSX 21.0 bug and the 16-OFFR alignment math.

## v0.91 — 2026-05-22

- **New: `--flash-size` option** (`2MB` or `8MB`) on `build` and `pack-folder`.
  Some early Yamanooto units shipped with 2MB flash; this lets the toolkit
  produce images sized for either model.
- Docs cleanup: removed references to a specific ASCII8 ROM dump that was an
  outlier (canonical Konami dumps are K4, not ASCII8). The conversion path is
  still documented and supported.

## v0.9 — 2026-05-22

First public release.

### Working
- Z80 launcher with menu, splash, and scrolling anti-scam marquee
- `pack-folder` builds an 8MB image from any folder of ROMs, auto-detecting
  the mapper via SHA1 lookup against openMSX's `softwaredb.xml`
- `build` reads a TOML config for explicit selection / per-game overrides
- `detect` identifies one or more ROMs (mapper, size, canonical title)
- ASCII8 → K5 converter (`ascii8_to_k5.py`)
- ASCII16 → K5 converter (`ascii16_to_k5.py`, experimental)
- SCC enable patcher (`scc_patch.py`)
- 16-OFFR alignment for SCC games (workaround for openMSX 21.0
  `Yamanooto::isSCCAccess()` bug — uses `bankRegs[]` instead of `rawBanks[]`)
- 8KB wrap-mirror for SCC games < 512K (saves 376K vs full 4× mirror)
- BIOS warm-boot fallback path for hook-based games (Metal Gear 2's H.CHGE)
- Short canonical titles for the in-cart menu (e.g. "Solid Snake" instead of
  "Metal Gear 2 - Solid Snake")
- Alphabetical sort in the menu
- MSX1/MSX2 disambiguation suffix (e.g. "King's Valley 2 MSX2")
- Page-2 slot setup at launcher INIT (BIOS leaves it as RAM)
- Trampoline lock of `ENAR.REGEN=0` so games can't accidentally clobber
  Yamanooto config

### Validated games
End-to-end tested in openMSX 21 with the `Yamanooto` mapper:
- 35+ Konami Mirrored 16/32K (Ping-Pong, Road Fighter, Antarctic Adventure,
  King's Valley, Knightmare 1, etc.)
- 7 Konami K4 (Vampire Killer, Penguin Adventure, Maze of Galious, Metal Gear,
  Usas, Firebird, Ganbare Goemon, Shalom)
- 14 Konami SCC including Salamander, Nemesis 1/2/3, F1 Spirit, Parodius,
  Space Manbow, Quarth, Gryzor (Contra), Gekitotsu Pennant Race 1/2,
  King's Valley 2 (MSX1 + MSX2), Hai no Majutsushi (Mahjong 2)
- 1 Konami SCC 512K with H.CHGE hook (Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake)
- ASCII8 → K5 conversion path (`ascii8_to_k5.py` + `mapper = "k5"`)

A typical mega-image with 59 Konami MSX cartridge titles fits in 5.3MB of the
8MB flash, leaving ~2.25MB spare for additional games.

### Known limitations / future work
- ASCII16 conversion is experimental (works in theory but unproven with a
  real ASCII16 SCC game)
- Some non-Konami publishers (Compile, Hudson) not in the catalog yet
- No tests / CI

### Credits
- **MFides** + **The SCC Alliance**: Yamanooto cartridge hardware + FPGA
- **Genami Retro Prototypes** (genami.shop): distribution
- **openMSX project**: emulator, Yamanooto extension, `softwaredb.xml`
- **Konami**: the games themselves (not redistributed here — bring your own)
